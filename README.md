# CarbonChain

CarbonChain is a mobile-based Web3 project that enables individuals to purchase carbon offsets using cryptocurrency. Our goal is to make it easier and more accessible for people to offset their carbon footprint and contribute to the fight against climate change.

## How it works

CarbonChain is built on the Ethereum blockchain, which provides a secure and transparent platform for carbon offsetting transactions. Our smart contract enables users to purchase carbon offsets using various cryptocurrencies, with clear rules and procedures for purchasing and verifying carbon offsets. Users can access the CarbonChain platform through a user-friendly mobile app, which allows them to view their carbon offsetting history, track their progress towards their carbon reduction goals, and learn more about the carbon offsetting projects they are supporting.


## Why CarbonChain?

CarbonChain provides a convenient and accessible way for individuals to take action against climate change. By purchasing carbon offsets, users can offset their carbon footprint and support projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions or remove carbon from the atmosphere.
With CarbonChain, users can be confident that their transactions are secure and transparent, with a clear record of their carbon offsetting history. Our platform also provides valuable insights and resources to help users reduce their carbon footprint and live more sustainably.


## Getting started
